# Turning Topics into a Curriculum

The technique outlined below is called "Understanding by Design" and, while somewhat painful to go through, yield amazing results.

In software, you should have acceptance tests that measure the entire functionality, integration tests that mix components together, and unit tests that test things in isolation. This is the same idea, applied to learning.

## Mechanics

In general, we teach using Pomodoros. This material lends itself to hands-on experiments. Now that we have the main ideas charted out, let's focus on the experiments.

Assume we have 25 minutes of instruction followed by 25 minutes of practice/experimentation.

## Exercise Design

### Last Things First

What's the *last* exercise they should do? It should bring everything together, within reason.

#### Base Expectations

* What do they need to start? (data, information, files, etc)
* How will they know they've met expectations? (results, output, etc)

I like to call these the "base expectations." Think of them like earning a "C" in school. Basically, you did what you had to do. The base expectations will likely repeat or closely echo the examples in the preceeding tutorial. They're not supposed to be hard, they're supposed to build confidence. If you "try," then you succeed.

#### Extensions

Now that they have confidence in the topics, how can they push their learning? Maybe here you tie in some of the earlier material, new tools that they have to learn themselves, more of "brain teasers." 

The extensions can have far less or even no instruction about "how" to do them, focus instead on the results. Let them connect the dots in between.

#### Instructional Material

What are the last things they'd learn right before diving into these exercises? Try and work backwards.

The last thing might be how to use an option of the tool. The second to last thing might be the default usage. The third to last could be the purpose of the tool itself.

Work backwards through that list until you have what looks like 25 minutes of material. Then cut off 5 minutes, because it always takes longer than you think.

Now you have the ending point for Exercises Last-1. What can they do at this point? Go back to defining Base Expectations.

#### Repeat Until You're Done

Repeat this process until you get back to your desired starting point, which should be "They open Terminal for the first time."
